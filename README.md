# Danmu-Comments-Killer-HTML

## Chrome Extension to remove keywords I don't like in bilibili video links
You should allow the chrome extension, go to "chrome://extensions/", <br>
choose "add load unpack", and select the folder of this package <br>
Then you can open the webpage, all comments with your dislike keywords will be removed.

###
Remind that I use built-in button to block danmu in the videos, not removing them. If you want to see them in the video, manually set it in the right part of the webpage.
